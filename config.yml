# essCore is a minecraft essentials plugin
# providing commands & features for daily
# use, it is still in the beta phase but
# i'm continuing to work on it hard to
# make it the better it can be.

# If you receive an error when loading essCore, make sure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe)
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks

# DISCLAIMER:
#   YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MODIFY THE CODE OF THE PLUGIN,
#   AND CLAIMING IT AS IT'S YOUR'S.
#   YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MODIFY THE CODE OF THE PLUGIN,
#   IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PERMISSION TO DO THAT.
