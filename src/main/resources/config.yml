#     EssCore is an essential plugin
# that provides useful commands & features

# If you receive an error when loading EssCore, make sure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe)
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks

# If you encounter bugs, please don't hesitate to report them
# over at EssCore's Github repository via the link below
# https://github.com/dotalw/EssCore/issues

# You can always find the online documentation over at
