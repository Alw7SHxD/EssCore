#     EssCore is an essential plugin
# that provides useful commands & features

# If you receive an error when loading EssCore, make sure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe)
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks

# If you encounter bugs, please don't hesitate to report them
# over at EssCore's Github repository via the link below
# https://github.com/dotalw/EssCore/issues

# You can always find the online documentation over at
# https://github.com/dotalw/EssCore/wiki

#  | DATABASE SETTINGS
#-=|

# Since EssCore version 0.10rc, the use of .yml files
# to store player, spawn, and warp information has been deprecated.
# In favor to replace it with a far better solution, which is using SQL
# databases in order to save such important information, with it being lightweight
# to some extent. As such, older versions (0.7.3 or lower) will not be supported
# by any means, even the data provided (in a migration) might be lost.
# You could always migrate (experimental feature) older version's data
# to the newer system, while it's not pitch perfect, but it should do the job.
database:

  # This will define the method that's going to be used by the plugin
  # to store the information on, remember that text files are not supported.
  #
  # ---------= Currently supported methods (DATABASES)
  #
  #                   Remote Databases
  # ----= MySQL
  #
  #                Flatfile/Local Databases
  # ----= H2
  # ----= SQLite
  #
  # EssCore by default comes with SQLite as it's default storage method.
  storage method: sqlite

  # The credentials section is used only if you're using a remote database as a storage method.
  # There's no need to touch this section if you're using a Flatfile/Local database.
  credentials:

    # Define the address and the port of the database.
    #  --
    # NOTE: MySQL's default port is 3306
    #  ++   You could use "host:port" if the port is different than the default.
    address: localhost

    # Database credentials
    username: root
    password: ''

    # This will be applied to all EssCore's tables.
    # It's useful when you're using it for different servers.
