#     EssCore is an essential plugin
# that provides useful commands & features

# If you receive an error when loading EssCore, make sure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe)
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks

# If you encounter bugs, please don't hesitate to report them
# over at EssCore's Github repository via the link below
# https://github.com/dotalw/EssCore/issues

# You can always find the online documentation over at
# https://github.com/dotalw/EssCore/wiki

#  | DATABASE SETTINGS
#-=|

# Since EssCore version 0.10rc, the use of .yml files
# to store player, spawn, and warp information has been deprecated.
# In favor to replace it with a far better solution, which is using SQL
# databases in order to save such important information, with it being lightweight
# to some extent. As such, older versions (0.7.3 or lower) will not be supported
# by any means, even the data provided (in a migration) might be lost.
# You could always migrate (experimental feature) older version's data
# to the newer system, while it's not pitch perfect, but it should do the job.
database:

  # This will define how the plugin will handle storing data.
  #
  # - Currently supported storage methods:
  #
  # | Remote Databases
  # |=> MySQL
  # |=> PostgreSQL
  #
  # | Flatfile/Local Databases
  # |=> H2
  # |=> SQLite
  #
  # EssCore by default comes with SQLite as it's default storage method.
  storage method: sqlite

  # Remote database properties
  # There's no need to touch this section if you're using a Flatfile/Local database.
  properties:

    # Define the address and the port of the database.

    address: localhost

    # Define the name of the database
    database name: esscore

    # Database credentials
    username: root

    # This will be applied to all EssCore's tables.
    # It's useful when you're using it for different servers.
